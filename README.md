# Refine

A project design and productivity tool for Flex Friday

## Accessing the App

The app is not deployed yet, but once it is, it will be available at [refine.gg](https://refine.gg).

## About

Making a project on Refine from start to finish is simple.

1. Create a project
2. Add collaborators and supervisors
3. Add tasks to the project with deadlines
4. Add subtasks to the tasks
5. If a task is not completed by its deadline, supervisors will be notified and the task will be marked as late.
   - Collaborators then make a plan to complete the task and submit it to the supervisors.
6. Once a task is completed, the collaborators will be notified and the task will be marked as complete, and the supervisors will give a grade to the task.
   - If the task is not completed to the satisfaction of the supervisors, the collaborators will be notified and the task will be marked as incomplete.
7. Once all tasks are completed, the project will be marked as complete.


my dad's input: (principal at Deering HS i think)
grading rubrics
can adults and students both assign deadlines
peer feedback
saving iterations
exemplar gallery
what's hard about flex friday for the adults? Fixes for those issues
parent interface?
dashboard
can peers see each other's work or progress?
gamify completion leaderboard
ways to tag projects so they can be grouped in different ways
features that give structure to the actual friday sessions?
comment/suggestion system
templates for timelines
all oriented toward high school students/teachers and long-term projects
maybe a landing page for PR purposes so that the school can show off the projects
